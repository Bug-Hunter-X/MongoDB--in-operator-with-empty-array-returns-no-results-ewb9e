# MongoDB $in Operator with Empty Array
This repository demonstrates a common issue when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries with an empty array.  The query returns no results, even if documents match other criteria.  The solution shows how to properly handle this scenario.

## Bug
The provided JavaScript code shows how an empty array used with the `$in` operator results in an empty result set.  This is unexpected behavior for developers expecting to retrieve all documents if the `$in` array is empty.

## Solution
The solution provided addresses the issue by using an alternative approach to handle cases where the `$in` array could be empty. The solution demonstrates conditional logic to bypass the `$in` clause when the array is empty, effectively returning all documents when needed.
